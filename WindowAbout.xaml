A stack is used by the LIFO algorithm to track the insertion order of pages. The most recent page is always present at the top of the stack. In case of a page fault, the page at the top of the stack will be replaced by the page that has been requested by the CPU. &#xA;&#x9;NRU algorithm removes a first page from the lowest numbered non-empty class. Implicit in this algorithm is that it is better to remove a modified page that has not been referenced in at least one clock tick than a clean page that is in heavy use.&#xA;When page is modified, a modified bit is set. When a page needs to be replaced, the Operating System divides pages into 4 classes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;0:- Not Referenced, Not Modified&#xA;&#x9;1:- Not Referenced, Modified&#xA;&#x9;2:- Referenced, Not Modified&#xA;&#x9;3:- Referenced, Modified&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;Out of above 4 categories, NRU will replace a Not Referenced, Not Modified page, if such page exists. Note that this algorithm implies that a Modified but Not Referenced is less important than a Not Modified and Referenced. To get a Modified bit in this program you need to end the name of page with 'b'. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;" VerticalAlignment="Center" TextAlignment="Justify" Width="NaN" Height="348" IsReadOnly="True" Background="{x:Null}" Margin="16,0,19,0"/>
